# EyeNav Cursor

EyeNav Cursor is a Python project that enables cursor control using eye movements. This project utilizes computer vision and eye tracking techniques to control the cursor on the screen.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Mediapipe (`mediapipe`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pyautogui`)

You can install these libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EyeNav-Cursor.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd EyeNav-Cursor
Run the eyenav_cursor.py script:
bash
Copy code
python eyenav_cursor.py
Calibrate the system to map eye movements to cursor movements.
Usage
Calibration: Run the calibration script to set up the initial mapping between eye movements and cursor movements.

Cursor Control: Once calibrated, run the main script (eyenav_cursor.py) to control the cursor using your eyes.
